# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 2 Hybrid Intelligence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 16 FRs map directly to acceptance scenarios — no orphaned requirements.
- SC-007 (zero Phase 1 regressions) is the key integration guard.
- Scope is tightly bounded: exactly 3 endpoints, 1 new DB table, isolated in `app/premium/`.
- Checklist: PASS — ready for `/sp.plan`.
